This is a project that encompasses 6 ignition source locations and 32 different smoke exhaust configurations, resulting in a total of 192 FDS computational outcomes. Each individual result is stored in a CSV file, with the file name following a specific pattern: for instance, the filename "100M32" signifies an ignition source located at Y=100 meters, "M" indicating the middle of the ignition lane, "U" denoting one side of the lane, and "32" representing the 32nd smoke exhaust configuration as described in the paper.
